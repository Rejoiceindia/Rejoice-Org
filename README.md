## Overview

RejoiceIndia is a community-driven initiative that focuses on implementing innovative technology solutions to revolutionize the real estate industry. Our community fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and the development of technology-driven real estate projects.

### Features:
- **Community Overview**: Information about the RejoiceIndia community.
- **Ongoing Projects**: Updates on active projects powered by our community.

## Tech Stack

The website is built with the following technologies:
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and tooling support.

## Setup & Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.0 or higher) – [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn** (optional, can be used as a package manager instead of npm).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/rejoiceindia-community-site.git
cd rejoiceindia-community-site
```

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project folder, install the required dependencies:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Using Yarn (optional):
```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Project

To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Using Yarn (optional):
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default. You can open this URL in your browser to view the site.

### Build for Production

To create a production build of the site, use the following command:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```

Using Yarn (optional):
```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized, production-ready version of the site in the `dist/` folder.
